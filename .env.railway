# Railway-specific environment variables
# These will be automatically set by Railway

# Railway provides these automatically:
# - DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection string)
# - PORT (Application port)
# - RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT (production/development)
# - RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID
# - RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID

# You need to manually set these in Railway Dashboard:
SECRET_KEY=change-this-to-a-random-secret-key-in-production
FLASK_ENV=production

# Optional: Custom MySQL (if not using Railway PostgreSQL)
# MYSQL_HOST=
# MYSQL_USER=
# MYSQL_PASSWORD=
# MYSQL_DB=
# MYSQL_PORT=3306
